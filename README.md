ALARM CLOCK

This script has been used to build a simple alarm clock function with a front end page. The user would be able to check the current time on top the page. In the middle of the page, the user can eneter the time to set the alarm. Once the "Set Alarm" button is clicked the alarm is set and is listed on the bottom of the page.

Multiple Alarms can be set at the same time. If the user wants to delete any of the alarms, a "Delete Alarm" button is provided against the alarm list in the bottom page clicking on which the alarm is deleted. 

When the Alarm time set is equal to the current time, an alert pops up on the screen noticing the user about the alarm time.
